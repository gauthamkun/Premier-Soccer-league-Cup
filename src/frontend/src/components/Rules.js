      <h3> Kick Ins:</h3>
      <li>The ball shall be kicked into play from the sideline, rather than thrown in. The ball is considered in play when the ball is touched and changes position. This is an indirect kick, and a goal cannot be scored from this kick.</li>

      <h3> Goal Kicks:</h3>
      <li>May be taken from any point of the goal box. All Goal Kicks are indirect kicks.</li>

      <h3> Penalty Kicks:</h3>
      <li>Shall be awarded if, in the referee’s opinion, a scoring opportunity was nullified by an infraction (the infraction does not automatically result in a red card). Penalty kicks are DIRECT kicks taken from 3 yards outside the box in the center of the goal.</li>

      <section>
      <h3> Hand Ball Clarification:</h3>
      <li>Goal keepers are restricted to using their hands only inside the penalty box and no slide tackling is allowed. If a player is sliding for the ball, contact with any player(s) from the other team is NOT ALLOWED. If a player slides and contact is initiated, a free kick shall be awarded. This does not prevent players from sliding to stop/intercept a ball where contact is not initiated during the slide. Example: a player may slide to save a ball from going out-of-bounds.</li>
