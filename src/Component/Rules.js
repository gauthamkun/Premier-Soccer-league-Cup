<h1>Rules</h1>
<h3> Player uniforms, jerseys, protective casts & jewelry:</h3>
<p>All players must wear shin guards, or will not be allowed to play.</p>
<p>All players must wear jerseys/shirts during play. If both teams are wearing the same color, the home team must change.</p>
<p>No jewelry will be allowed, including earrings of any type, rope necklaces and bracelets. The only exception will be players wearing medical bracelets.</p>
<h3>Substitution</h3><p> Substitutions can be made on the fly.</p>
<h3>Kick Offs</h3>
<p>May be kicked in any direction. You cannot score directly from a kick off (ball must be 100% over the mid-line to be considered on the offensive half of the field). The kick off is an indirect kick. </p>
<h3>kick ins</h3>
<p>The ball shall be kicked into play from the sideline, rather than thrown in. The ball is considered in play when the ball is touched and changes position. This is an indirect kick, and a goal cannot be scored from this kick.</p>
<h3>Goal kicks</h3>
<p>May be taken from any point of the goal box. All Goal Kicks are indirect kicks.</p>
<h3>Penalty kicks</h3>
<p>Shall be awarded if, in the referee’s opinion, a scoring opportunity was nullified by an infraction (the infraction does not automatically result in a red card). Penalty kicks are DIRECT kicks taken from 3 yards outside the box in the center of the goal.</p>
<h3>Hand Ball Clarification</h3>
<p>Goal keepers are restricted to using their hands only inside the penalty box and no slide tackling is allowed. If a player is sliding for the ball, contact with any player(s) from the other team is NOT ALLOWED. If a player slides and contact is initiated, a free kick shall be awarded. This does not prevent players from sliding to stop/intercept a ball where contact is not initiated during the slide. Example: a player may slide to save a ball from going out-of-bounds.</p>
<h3>Roster:</h3>
<p>Every team has to hand in a roster with all the player names and their Date of Birth</p>
<h3>Tournament Rules:</h3>
<li>Kick off – may be taken in any direction.</li>
<li> NO GOAL may be scored from kick off (start of game)</li>
<li>FIRST WHISTLE STARTS THE CLOCK ON ALL FIELDS and GAME ENDING WHISTLE ENDS GAMES ON ALL FIELDS.</li>
